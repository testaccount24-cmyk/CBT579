Sam,

Since my contribution is small in size and I'm only using it with
the Tachyon cross assembler, I decided to send it with the email
and hope that if you find value you can put it in the correct
format for distribution.

The documentation is in the macro header, but I've extracted it
here for you to see.  In a nutshell, the macro adds BREAK and
CONTINUE support to the structured programming macros included
with the HLASM toolkit.  Note that it does not replace IBM's
offering; the HLASM toolkit must be present for this to work.

Please let me know if you need any further information.  I can be
contacted at work tim_patriquin@bmc.com or home tpatriqu@onr.com.

Best Regards,
Tim Patriquin
